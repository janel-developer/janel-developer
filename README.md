# Hi! I'm Janel.

Welcome to my github profile. I am a software developer with more than 20 years experience, most of which I owe to IBM where I was an AIX developer.

I'm currently a developer at Clipchamp, and I'm having a blast with my team there, enabling everyone to tell their stories with video.

I've also been introduced to an incredible community of people through Twitter. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/janelbrandon12" target="_blank">@janelbrandon12</a>.

I use this repository to play, and to create things that help me and others to learn.
